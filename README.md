# Kapsel Sample Repository

I will use this repository to share some of my sample kapsel applications. 

<p><b>Kapsel Sample Ref Small App</b><br>
This is a small sample app which consists only of two files (index.html and one JavaScript helper file). 
Create a Cordova project and add SAP's Kapsel Logon and Logger plugin. After that copy these two files into the www folder, 
adapt your own SMP or HCPms realted server settings in file SMPHelper.js, then prepare and run the app.
