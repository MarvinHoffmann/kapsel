# Kapsel Sample Repository

I will use this repository to share some of my sample kapsel applications. 

<p><b>Kapsel Sample Ref Small App</b><br>
This is a small sample app which consists only of two files (index.html and one JavaScript helper file). 
Create a Cordova project and add SAP's Kapsel Logon and Logger plugin. After that copy these two files into the www folder, 
adapt your own SMP or HCPms realted server settings in file SMPHelper.js, then prepare and run the app.

In following blog entry this scenario is described in detail: <br>

<p><b>Kapsel Custom Certificate Provider for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10</b><br>
This is a sample certificate provider which will load a user certificate from the assets folder and will store it into the app's keychain. 
The custom certificate provider will be called by Kapsel Logon Plugin.
